        <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            As Archimedes would have said (without the fine print), "Give me the value of the function at a single point,<br>
            and the value of all (first, second, and so on) its derivatives, and I can give you the value of the function<br> 
            at any other point". It is very important to note that the Taylor series is not asking for the expression of <br>
            the function and its derivatives, just the value of the function and its derivatives at a single point.
